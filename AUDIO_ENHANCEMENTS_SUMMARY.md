# Audio Processing Enhancements Summary

## ðŸŽµ Enhanced Audio Processing Features

### **New Capabilities Added**

#### 1. **5.1 Surround from 7.1 Creation**
- **What**: When processing files with 7.1 surround (8 channels) but no existing 5.1 track, automatically creates a 5.1 version
- **How**: Uses FFmpeg pan filter to mix side surround channels into back surround channels
  - Formula: `BL = BL + 0.7*SL, BR = BR + 0.7*SR`
- **Benefit**: Provides compatibility for devices/setups that prefer 5.1 over 7.1

#### 2. **Enhanced Stereo Downmix with Boosted Center Channel**
- **What**: Improved stereo creation from surround with significantly boosted center channel for better dialogue clarity
- **Important**: Center channel boost is **ONLY applied to stereo tracks**, 5.1 tracks maintain original balance
- **Changes**:
  - **Old Formula**: `c0=0.4*FL+0.283*FC+0.4*BL | c1=0.4*FR+0.283*FC+0.4*BR`
  - **New Formula**: `c0=0.35*FL+0.5*FC+0.25*BL | c1=0.35*FR+0.5*FC+0.25*BR`
- **Improvement**: Center channel boost from 0.283 to 0.5 (77% increase) for much clearer dialogue in stereo
- **Benefit**: Fixes hard-to-hear dialogue in shows like Star Trek Original Series on stereo playback

### **Audio Track Creation Logic**

When processing a video file, the system now creates:

#### **For 7.1 Source (8 channels)**:
1. **Original 7.1** (preserved, stream 0)
2. **5.1 Surround** (created from 7.1, stream 1) - *NEW*
3. **Enhanced Stereo** (created from 5.1, stream 2) - *ENHANCED*

#### **For 5.1 Source (6 channels)**:
1. **Original 5.1** (preserved, stream 0)  
2. **Enhanced Stereo** (created from 5.1, stream 1) - *ENHANCED*

### **Technical Implementation Details**

#### **5.1 from 7.1 Filter**:
```bash
pan=5.1|c0=c0|c1=c1|c2=c2|c3=c3|c4=c4+0.7*c6|c5=c5+0.7*c7
```
- Preserves FL, FR, FC, LFE directly (maintains original center channel balance)
- Mixes side surrounds (c6, c7) into back surrounds (c4, c5) with 0.7 weighting
- **No center channel boost** - keeps original surround sound balance

#### **Enhanced Stereo Filter**:
```bash
pan=stereo|c0=0.35*c0+0.5*c2+0.25*c4|c1=0.35*c1+0.5*c2+0.25*c5,acompressor=level_in=1.5:threshold=0.1:ratio=6:attack=20:release=250
```
- **Center channel boost ONLY applied to stereo** (0.5 vs 0.283 previously)
- Slightly reduced front and surround channels to compensate
- Maintains dynamic range compression for consistent levels
- **5.1 tracks maintain original audio balance**

### **Smart Detection and Processing**

The system intelligently detects:
- **Existing Tracks**: Won't duplicate if 5.1 or stereo already exist
- **Channel Layouts**: Only processes streams with known channel layouts
- **Language Filtering**: Only processes English or unlabeled audio streams
- **Format Optimization**: Uses AAC encoding with appropriate channel layout metadata

### **Logging and Feedback**

Enhanced logging now shows:
- Detection of 7.1 vs 5.1 sources
- Creation of 5.1 from 7.1 tracks
- Enhanced stereo creation with boosted center channel
- Clear indication of which tracks are being created and why

### **Use Cases Improved**

1. **Dialogue-Heavy Content**: Star Trek, dramas, documentaries with clearer speech
2. **7.1 Movie Files**: Now get both 5.1 and enhanced stereo for maximum compatibility  
3. **Multi-Device Playback**: Original surround + optimized stereo for different playback scenarios
4. **Center Channel Focus**: Content where dialogue is crucial gets proper audio treatment

### **Backward Compatibility**

- All existing functionality preserved
- Existing files with proper audio tracks won't be re-processed unnecessarily
- Same webhook integration and batch processing capabilities
- Configuration and environment variable support unchanged

*These enhancements specifically address dialogue clarity issues while maintaining the original surround experience and adding compatibility options for different playback scenarios.*
