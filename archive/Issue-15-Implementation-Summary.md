# Issue #15 Implementation Summary

**Repository Organization and Cleanup - COMPLETED**

## Changes Made

### 1. Directory Structure
- ✅ Created `/docs/` directory for documentation
- ✅ Created `/archive/` directory for archived content
- ✅ Created `/archive/legacy/` for removed component documentation

### 2. File Moves
- ✅ Moved `scripts/LOG_MANAGEMENT.md` → `docs/LOG_MANAGEMENT.md`
- ✅ Documented removal of empty `ovpn/` ZFS dataset

### 3. Configuration Updates
- ✅ Updated `.gitignore` with organized sections:
  - Runtime and generated files
  - Development and IDE files
  - Log files and backups
  - OS-specific ignores
  - Service-specific configurations

### 4. Legacy Cleanup
- ✅ Removed obsolete `ovpn/` ZFS dataset (Storage/docker/mediabox/ovpn)
- ✅ Destroyed all associated automatic snapshots
- ✅ Documented removal rationale and technical details

## Repository Structure After Organization

```
mediabox/
├── docs/                          # Documentation (NEW)
│   ├── README.md
│   └── LOG_MANAGEMENT.md          # Moved from scripts/
├── archive/                       # Archived content (NEW)
│   ├── README.md                  # Archive directory documentation
│   ├── legacy/                    # Legacy component documentation
│   │   └── ovpn-directory-removed.txt
│   └── legacy-scripts/            # Existing legacy scripts
├── scripts/                       # Active automation scripts
├── .gitignore                     # Reorganized and cleaned up
└── [other directories unchanged]
```

## Benefits Achieved

1. **Improved Maintainability**: Clear separation of documentation, active code, and archived content
2. **Reduced Clutter**: Removed obsolete ZFS dataset and organized file structure
3. **Better Documentation**: Centralized docs/ directory with clear organization
4. **Clean Version Control**: Updated .gitignore prevents accidental commits of generated files
5. **Preserved History**: Archive system maintains context of removed components

## Technical Notes

- **ZFS Dataset Removal**: Required `sudo zfs destroy -r` due to automatic snapshots
- **Git Organization**: Files moved using `git mv` to preserve history
- **Backward Compatibility**: No breaking changes to active functionality

## Related Issues

- **Issue #16**: WireGuard implementation enabled ovpn/ removal
- **Issue #7**: Automated backup system (next priority)
- **Issue #10**: Dependency management improvements (next priority)
