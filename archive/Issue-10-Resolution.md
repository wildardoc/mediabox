# Issue #10 Resolution: Just-In-Time Dependency Management

## Decision Summary
**RESOLVED: Adopt just-in-time dependency approach rather than preemptive expansion**

## Analysis Results

After comprehensive analysis of the current mediabox codebase, the proposed enhanced dependencies would only provide value when specific future features are implemented:

### Current State ✅
```
ffmpeg-python==0.2.0  # Actively used for media processing
future==1.0.0         # Actively used for Python 2/3 compatibility
```

### Proposed Enhancement Analysis 📊
- **`requests`**: Would be valuable for API integration with *arr services, Plex library refresh
- **`pyyaml`**: Would be useful when migrating from JSON to YAML configuration
- **`packaging`**: Would help with version checking and container management
- **Dev tools**: Would be needed for CI/CD pipeline and contributor workflow

### Reality Check 🎯
**NONE of these dependencies are currently needed** by existing functionality. Adding them now would:
- ❌ Increase installation time and container size
- ❌ Add maintenance overhead for unused dependencies
- ❌ Provide no immediate value to users

## Resolution Strategy

### ✅ **Adopt Just-In-Time Dependency Management**

**Implementation Approach:**
1. **Keep current minimal requirements.txt** 
2. **Add dependencies only when features require them**
3. **Document dependency rationale in commit messages**
4. **Consider optional feature flags for enhanced functionality**

### Future Implementation Examples

**When API integration is added:**
```bash
# Add to requirements.txt:
requests>=2.25.0        # For *arr API integration and Plex refresh
```

**When YAML configuration is implemented:**
```bash
# Add to requirements.txt:
pyyaml>=6.0            # For YAML-based configuration system
```

**When CI/CD pipeline is established:**
```bash
# Create requirements-dev.txt:
pytest>=6.0           # Testing framework
black>=22.0            # Code formatting
flake8>=4.0           # Linting
```

## Benefits of This Approach

### ✅ **Immediate Benefits**
- **Faster installations**: Minimal dependency footprint
- **Reduced complexity**: Only install what's actually used  
- **Lower maintenance**: Fewer dependencies to track and update

### ✅ **Long-term Benefits**
- **Purposeful additions**: Each dependency added for specific functionality
- **Clear rationale**: Dependencies tied to concrete features
- **User choice**: Optional enhanced features don't bloat base installation

### ✅ **Development Benefits**
- **Focused development**: Add dependencies when features are ready
- **Testing efficiency**: Only test dependencies that are actually used
- **Documentation clarity**: Dependency purpose is obvious from commit context

## Conclusion

**Issue #10 - RESOLVED with just-in-time approach**

This decision aligns with mediabox's lean, production-ready philosophy. Dependencies will be added as features are developed, ensuring each addition provides immediate value while maintaining the system's efficiency and simplicity.

## Related Issues
- Issue #7 (automated backup) may benefit from `requests` for API calls
- Future YAML configuration improvements would utilize `pyyaml`
- CI/CD implementation would require development dependencies
