Legacy ovpn/ Directory Removed
==============================

The empty ovpn/ ZFS dataset was removed as part of repository organization (Issue #15).

Background:
- Directory was used for OpenVPN configuration files in legacy versions
- With WireGuard implementation (Issue #16), this directory became obsolete
- Directory was empty and no longer referenced by any active code
- Only reference remaining was in .gitignore for security

Technical Details:
- Was a ZFS dataset: Storage/docker/mediabox/ovpn
- Had automatic snapshots (hourly, daily, weekly, monthly)
- Required recursive destruction: `sudo zfs destroy -r Storage/docker/mediabox/ovpn`

Removal Date: August 12, 2025
Related Issues: #15 (Repository Organization), #16 (WireGuard Implementation)
