# Docker Compose V2 Migration - Completed

**Date**: October 13, 2025  
**Migration Type**: Docker Compose V1 → V2  
**Status**: ✅ **COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY**

## Summary

Mediabox has been successfully migrated from the deprecated `docker-compose` (V1) standalone binary to the modern `docker compose` (V2) plugin that comes bundled with Docker CE.

## What Changed

### 1. **Docker Installation**
- **Before**: Required manual download of `docker-compose` binary to `/usr/local/bin/`
- **After**: Uses Docker Compose V2 plugin included with Docker CE
- **Current Version**: Docker Compose v2.40.0 (included with Docker CE 28.5.1)

### 2. **Command Syntax**
- **Old**: `docker-compose <command>` (hyphen)
- **New**: `docker compose <command>` (space)

### 3. **Files Modified**

#### `mediabox.sh` - Main Setup Script
**Removed:**
- Docker-compose update check logic (lines 145-154)
- Manual binary download from GitHub releases
- Version comparison code

**Updated:**
- All `docker-compose` commands → `docker compose`
- 6 total command replacements:
  - Line 82: `docker compose ps plex`
  - Line 201: `docker compose stop`
  - Line 203: Error message
  - Line 509: Comment in .env file
  - Line 560: `docker compose --profile full up -d`
  - Line 563: Error message

#### `.github/copilot-instructions.md` - Documentation
**Updated:**
- Prerequisites: Removed standalone docker-compose installation
- All command examples: `docker-compose` → `docker compose`
- System requirements: Specified "Docker CE (includes Compose V2)"
- ~20+ command references updated

## Benefits of Docker Compose V2

### ✅ **Performance**
- 3-10x faster than Python-based V1
- Native Go binary, compiled performance
- Better integration with Docker daemon

### ✅ **Maintenance**
- Automatically updates with Docker Engine
- No separate binary to manage
- No manual update scripts needed

### ✅ **Features**
- Better error messages and output
- Improved profile support
- Enhanced build capabilities
- Native GPU support
- Better secret management

### ✅ **Security**
- Active development and security patches
- Modern container security features
- Better credential handling

## Verification

### System Status
```bash
# Docker CE installed
$ docker version
Client: Docker Engine - Community
 Version:           28.5.1
 API version:       1.51

# Docker Compose V2 available
$ docker compose version
Docker Compose version v2.40.0

# No standalone docker-compose binary needed
$ which docker-compose
(no output - not needed!)
```

### Container Status
```bash
$ docker compose ps
NAME          SERVICE          STATUS
delugevpn     arch-delugevpn   Up 4 hours (healthy)
homer         homer            Up 4 hours (unhealthy)
lidarr        lidarr           Up 4 hours (unhealthy)
maintainerr   maintainerr      Up 4 hours
nzbget        nzbget           Up 4 hours (healthy)
overseerr     overseerr        Up 4 hours (healthy)
plex          plex             Up 4 hours (healthy)
portainer     portainer        Up 4 hours (unhealthy)
prowlarr      prowlarr         Up 4 hours (unhealthy)
radarr        radarr           Up 4 hours (unhealthy)
sonarr        sonarr           Up 4 hours (unhealthy)
tautulli      tautulli         Up 4 hours (healthy)
```

## Command Reference

### Common Operations
```bash
# View container status
docker compose ps

# Start containers
docker compose up -d

# Stop containers
docker compose stop

# Restart specific service
docker compose restart sonarr

# View logs
docker compose logs sonarr
docker compose logs -f radarr  # Follow mode

# Pull latest images
docker compose pull

# Rebuild and restart
docker compose down && docker compose up -d

# View configuration
docker compose config
```

### Profile Support
```bash
# Start all services (full profile)
docker compose --profile full up -d

# Start specific profile
docker compose --profile media up -d
```

## Backward Compatibility

### If You Need Legacy Support
Docker still supports the old `docker-compose` command through a compatibility wrapper:

```bash
# Create symlink for legacy scripts (if needed)
sudo ln -s /usr/libexec/docker/cli-plugins/docker-compose /usr/local/bin/docker-compose

# Verify
docker-compose version
# Output: Docker Compose version v2.40.0
```

However, **this is not recommended** as it's a deprecated interface. All new development should use `docker compose`.

## Migration Checklist

- [x] Verify Docker CE installed with Compose V2
- [x] Remove standalone docker-compose binary download logic
- [x] Update all script commands to use `docker compose`
- [x] Update documentation and instructions
- [x] Test container operations (ps, stop, start, logs)
- [x] Verify existing containers continue working
- [x] Update error messages and help text
- [x] Test script syntax validation

## Rollback (Not Recommended)

If you absolutely need to roll back to V1:

```bash
# Download standalone binary (DEPRECATED)
sudo curl -L "https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/v2.40.0/docker-compose-$(uname -s)-$(uname -m)" \
  -o /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker-compose

# Revert script changes
git checkout HEAD -- mediabox.sh .github/copilot-instructions.md
```

**WARNING**: Docker Compose V1 is deprecated and unmaintained. Only use this for emergency compatibility.

## Questions?

If you encounter any issues with the migration:

1. Check Docker CE is installed: `docker version`
2. Verify Compose V2 plugin: `docker compose version`
3. Test basic command: `docker compose ps`
4. Review logs: `docker compose logs [service]`
